# Process Scheduling Simulator
The repo contains files for a process scheduling simulator as part of an Operating System course project under the professor Muktikanta Sahu. 
The JAR executable is a simulator that visualizes the execution of several processes on a single core CPU with user-specified arrival time, burst size and priority. 
The following scheduling algorithms have been implemented (can be found in "src/algorithm")
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Priority Pre-emptive(PP) 
- Priority Non Pre-emptive(PNP)

The application was built with JavaFX in netbeans and looks like this:

For the above input, the output is
